Implementation of Paper "Transformers in Image Compression" `2111.06707v1.pdf` using CompressAI and Streamlit

This project implements the complete image compression framework described in the paper located at `2111.06707v1.pdf`. The model is built on top of the CompressAI library and includes the VAE-based autoencoder, hyperprior network, Neural Transformation Units (NTUs), and the Causal Attention Module (CAM). A Streamlit interface is provided for uploading images, performing compression, viewing reconstructed outputs, and analyzing bitrate and quality metrics.

## Features
- Full implementation of the architecture presented in the paper.
- CompressAI-based codec with custom NTUs and CAM modules.
- Streamlit web interface for interactive testing.
- Support for bitrate calculation, PSNR, SSIM, and reconstructed outputs.
